### Selenium Attempt
Document translator in python using selenium.
Use this Python script to translate docs in a folder to english using google translate.
You would need selinum and chrome driver for your chrome version.

I will keep updating this as i come up with different uproaches since google translate might not allow this later.

If you find this helpful please give it a star.
